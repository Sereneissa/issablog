                <h2>Story Book Photography: My Passion</h2>
                <p>
                  Anyone who has read the stories from Humans of New York is familiar with the striking emotional journey that 
                  the readers are taken on.The bounds are suddenly broken between the reader and the storyteller. 
                  The image that is paired with the story captures a moment in time in which we can feel the pure vulnerability of the individual behind the screen.

                  Brandon Stanton grew up in Marietta, Georgia and attended college in his hometown at the University of Georgia, studying History. 
                  In 2010, Stanton bought his first camera, a Canon EOS 5D Mark III with a 50mm f/1.2 lens, while working as a bond trader in Chicago. 
                  After two years of working as a bond trader and doing photography on the weekends as a hobby, Stanton lost his job. He noted in a Shutterbug interview that after he lost his job, he went for a walk and asked himself, “What is it I want to do with my life?” He remembered feeling physically and emotionally tired from having his creative energy restricted while working as a bond trader. In order to set out and figure out his passion, he decided to take a couple months off and live on just enough money to keep him going.

                <p>
                  We only have 24 hours in a day. If we factor in roughly eight hours of sleep and four hours of meal time, we really only have 12 hours in a day. If we then factor in distractions and a sense of being overwhelmed with our massive 'to-do list,' we quickly feel that we simply don't have enough time in the day to complete important tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the added stressor of COVID-19 dominating our everyday life, we might also feel less accomplished, due to increased distractions we experience from being constantly at home (and surrounded by family, the TV etc).

                  Ever considered how your neighbor, your gym, or even your phone could make a substantial impact on your health? The people around you and the community you live in can affect several aspects of your life. In addition, the digital community you build can have just as much of a positive impact on your life as those who physically surround you.

                </p>
                <p>
                  In Creating Healthy Communities, Healthy Homes, Healthy People: Initiating a Research Agenda on the Built Environment and Public Health, the authors state that “human-modified places such as homes, schools, workplaces, parks, industrial areas, farms, roads and highways— are our most important habitat.” These are all various components of a community, which can stem from the house you live in, the school you go to in your district, or the gym that you use close by.
